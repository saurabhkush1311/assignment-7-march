    "#Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in a dataset's probability distribution. In data analysis and statistics, skewness helps to describe the shape of the distribution and how the data points are spread on either side of the central value (mean, median, or mode). Skewness is an essential concept as it provides insights into the departure from a symmetrical distribution and can impact the interpretation and analysis of data."

However, when the outlier (100) is included, the mean becomes (10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 100) / 6 ≈ 31.67. The outlier pulls the mean towards higher values.\n",
